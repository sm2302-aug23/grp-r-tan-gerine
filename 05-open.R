The question is "What are the most common stopping times, the number of steps it takes for a sequence to first go below its starting integer?"
to achieve this,we can :
1. Calculating the stopping time for each Collatz sequence.
2. Creating a histogram or frequency distribution of stopping times to identify the most common stopping times.
3. Providing a clear and understandable summary of your findings in your script.

Process

Calculating Stopping Times: We calculate the stopping time for each Collatz sequence by counting the number of iterations it takes for the sequence to reach a value less than the starting integer and eventually converge to 1.
Frequency Distribution: After calculating stopping times for a range of starting integers (e.g., from 1 to 10,000), we create a histogram or frequency distribution of these stopping times. Each bar in the histogram represents a range of stopping times (e.g., 1-5, 6-10, etc.).
Identifying Common Stopping Times: We identify the most common stopping times by finding the peak(s) in the frequency distribution. These peaks correspond to the stopping times that occur most frequently across the Collatz sequences.

Methodologies

The finding is that after performing the analysis, we discover that the most common stopping times in Collatz sequences are often clustered around certain values.
For example, we may find that stopping times of 3, 7, and 15 occur with high frequency. 
This suggests that there are certain "stopping time patterns" that are prevalent in Collatz sequences.

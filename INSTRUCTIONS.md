## Instructions

**IMPORTANT! READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY**

<!-- - Write all of your R code in a single `solution.R`. **Only the code contained within this file will be assessed**. -->

- It is important that you name your functions and variables **as instructed**, as your solutions will be auto-graded.

- The code in your script file should be able to be run without any errors.

- Note that not only will you be graded on the correctness of your code but also on creativity, code styling, the proper use of GitHub, as well as following instructions. Therefore, ensure that you

   - Style your code correctly--Refer to the Tidyverse Style Guide at https://style.tidyverse.org/;
   - Use comments where appropriate;
   - Cite your sources (failure to do so will result in penalties for plagiarism).

## GitHub Classroom autograding and unit tests

The repo contains a folder named `tests/` which contains scripts to perform unit testing of your code in `solution.R`. **DO NOT TAMPER WITH THIS FOLDER**. 

During your code development, you may run the tests locally:

```r
library(testthat)
test_dir("tests/testthat")
```

These tests are designed to check the conformity of your code to the instructions posted in the tasks, but not necessarily the *mathematical correctness* of your code. Nonetheless, the aim is to pass all the unit tests!
